since forever i’ve enjoyed pulling stuff apart. mother wasn’t the biggest fan of little me running around with a rogue screwdriver, cracking open toys just to see how they worked. but that curiosity never really left.
as i got older, the stuff i tore into got more serious. one of the first “real” things was this old MSI laptop my mother gave me when she upgraded. i’ve had that thing in bits more times than i can count—took it apart, poked around, put it back together. over and over. eventually it just got way too slow, even for me.
so i said fuck it and dropped all my money on a new laptop (should’ve gone desktop, but teenage me didn’t know nothing yet). it was an acer nitro 5 with an rtx 3050M. Terrible pick looking back, but at the time? it was insane—going from max 20fps in everything to nearly 100 it blew my mind.
used that for a while but then started upgrading everything else—got a new mouse, keyboard, monitor, mic, everything.
when I was doing a work placement (with the most amazing computer technician I’ve met he will forever be my role model) last year, I got given an old computer that the guy was going to throw away, that’s when I knew it was the time to finally get a pretty desktop my pretty desktop
the case? janky and weird-looking by normal standards, but it was beautiful. I’ve always liked old stuff other people see as junk.

it had 16gb ddr4 (single channel lmao), some pentium chip, and a pretty decent LGA1200 board. bit out of date but still solid—back when intel still cared about making processors.
so i ordered a better cpu and cooler (the old one made this terrible noise and I wanted to have lights so I could be like all the cucks with rgb this and that) and a rx6600 (perfect for me and no one else I don’t play or appreciate modern AAA games the only semi recent performance intensive thing I play is satisfactory and some odd VR(the 6600 is a vr budget BEAST))
